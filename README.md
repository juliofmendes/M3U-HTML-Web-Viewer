# M3U-HTML-Web-Viewer

This code reads URLs of videos from a text file, generates HTML and JavaScript code to display them in a webpage, and opens the webpage in a browser. The HTML code creates a container for the videos and defines their size, and the JavaScript code uses the Hls.js library to load and play the videos. The URLs of the videos are passed to the JavaScript code and the videos are attached to the corresponding video element in HTML and then played.
